        <pre>The most impressive development to me so far is the blockchain.
            It was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008
            It is used to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin
            More specifically, it allows people to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server
            It does give human considerable influence. For instance, Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions
            i have been firmly impressed by this development because it has a huge impact on the world
